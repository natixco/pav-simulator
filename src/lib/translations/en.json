    "1": "The Pályaalkalmassági Vizsgálat (PÁV) is a mandatory psychological and skills assessment for professional drivers in Hungary. In addition to computer-based tests that evaluate reaction speed and attention, the process also includes a personal interview with a psychologist to assess personality traits and driving attitude.",

  "MONOTONY_TEST": {
    "TITLE": "Monotony test",
    "INSTRUCTIONS": {
      "DESCRIPTION": "The monotony test presents repeated visual patterns. Your task is to quickly decide if the bottom pattern matches the category of correct patterns shown above. The test measures sustained attention under monotonous conditions.",
      "DESCRIPTION2": "The official test may use different visual patterns; this simulator captures the general idea only. There is no public, official documentation on the exact scoring method and the duration of the test, but it takes between 5–10 minutes.",
      "STEPS": {
        "GOAL": "Goal: If the bottom pattern is in the correct set, press Yes; otherwise press No.",
        "KEYS": "Keys: \"C\" = Yes, \"M\" = No.",
        "DURATION": "Duration: The test runs for 7 minutes unless you stop it.",
        "SCORING": "Scoring: Each response counts toward your total; correct answers increase your score.",
        "TIPS": "Tip: Focus on the structural rules of the correct set rather than memorizing individual shapes."
